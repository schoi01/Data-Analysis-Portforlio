## About me
Hey there, I'm Suyeon! I am a fourth-year Mathematics student at UBC, with a passion for exploring the world through data. I am driven, eager, and always ready for a new challenge. Whether it is solving complex problems or discovering hidden insights, I love figuring out how numbers and patterns can help us understand the world better. What started as a simple curiosity has quickly grown into something I am excited to dive into every day.

Along with my math studies, I have also developed a strong background in Computer Science and Statistics. This has given me the perfect toolkit to dive into the exciting world of data analysis. It has been both interesting and fun to build a deep understanding of the tools and techniques required to derive meaningful insights from data. With a background in these fields, I am confident and excited to apply my skills in real-world projects as I look ahead to my career as an entry-level data specialist.

I am here to share my journey and my projects with you. Take a look at my projects to see what I have been working on â€” each one reflects my passion for data and commitment to make it work for us!
